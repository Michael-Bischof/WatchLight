# WatchLight
Can't find the switch in a dark room? Can't find the keyhole after coming home late? Tripped over something in the dark again? 

Suffer no more! 

Introducing: WatchLight - The flashlight on your AppleWatch

# Features
- native Swift 2.0 WatchOS app (works without iPhone)
- Glance for fast access and smaller flashlight
- Force Touch for information on how to enhance your WatchLight experience

# Information
Apple does not want this app on the AppStore because:

- They don't want any flashlight apps anymore. Does not matter that this one is different than any other one. What!?
- the glance is not used to display information
- if used over a long period of time without turning the display off, the Apple Watch could get hot. Duh.

Hope you enjoy the app. Feel free to use and modify it as you wish.
